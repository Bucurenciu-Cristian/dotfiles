# Session Summary: UV Hook Migration Project
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-24 12:17:25  
**Session Type**: Infrastructure Migration  
**Primary Objective**: Migrate from legacy Python hooks to pure UV-based hook system

---

## üéØ Mission Overview

**User Directive**: *"I want to keep this UV approach, the rest is dust"*

Successfully executed a complete migration from a mixed hook environment (legacy Python + UV scripts) to a pure UV-based Claude Code hook system. The project involved system analysis, safe migration, critical issue resolution, and comprehensive cleanup.

## üìã Key Actions Performed

### 1. **Initial System Analysis** (Turns 1-8)
- **Sequential MCP Analysis**: Deep comparison of two hook repositories
- **Repository Mapping**: claude-code-hooks-mastery vs github/claude-hooks
- **Hook Classification**: Identified 8 active UV hooks vs 15 legacy Python hooks
- **Architecture Assessment**: Distinguished functional implementations from disabled stubs

### 2. **Safe Migration Planning** (Turns 9-15)
- **Backup Creation**: Multiple backup locations with comprehensive documentation
  - Primary: `/home/kicky/.claude/hooks_backup_2024_08_24/`  
  - Legacy: `/home/kicky/.claude/hooks_legacy_backup_20250824_110337/`
- **Migration Manifest**: Complete restoration procedures and file inventory
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified potential breaking points and mitigation strategies

### 3. **Critical Issue Resolution** (Turns 16-25)
- **üö® Hook Path Crisis**: Resolved "No such file or directory" errors
  - Root Cause: Relative paths in settings.json
  - Solution: Created settings_uv_clean.json with absolute paths
  - User Impact: Required multiple Claude Code restarts and config disabling
- **Security Hook Integration**: Worked with security hooks using Python cleanup script
- **Configuration Caching**: Guided user through system restarts to clear cached settings

### 4. **System Cleanup & Verification** (Turns 26-32)
- **Legacy Removal**: 15 Python hooks + 7 .original files + various artifacts
- **UV Preservation**: All 8 UV hooks + utility modules + logging system
- **Functionality Verification**: Real-time logging confirmed across all hook events
- **Architecture Validation**: Clean directory structure with no legacy artifacts
